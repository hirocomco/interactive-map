This project is for displying a data from a research we did about search volume for outdoor activities for each us state.
The data is available on "State-by-State Favorite Outdoor Activity - Final Data.csv"
It shold be an interactive us map that shows the data dynamically.
when working on this:
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
